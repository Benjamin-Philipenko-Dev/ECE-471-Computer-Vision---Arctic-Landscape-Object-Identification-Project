**Automatic Image Segmentation for Arctic Landscapes**

**Introduction:**
This repository contains the implementation of a computer vision solution for automatic segmentation of RGB color images, specifically tailored for arctic landscapes. The objective is to develop a system capable of identifying and labeling various objects and regions of interest within the provided sample images. The segmentation process is crucial for understanding image content, enabling further image processing techniques such as object detection and environmental monitoring.

**Motivation:**
The motivation behind this project stems from the increasing need for automated image analysis to support environmental conservation efforts. Manual segmentation of images is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human errors. By developing an automated segmentation system, our goal is to streamline the analysis process and extract meaningful information from large image datasets. This technology can significantly aid applications such as environmental monitoring and wildlife conservation.

**Project Scope:**
The project scope involves creating a computer vision solution using various algorithms to effectively partition images into distinct regions based on color and spatial characteristics. The identified regions may include sky, iceberg, water, ground, penguins, etc. These segmented regions serve as a foundation for further analysis and interpretation of the image content.

**Implementation Details:**
The implementation utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and algorithms to perform image segmentation. The code is written in Python, leveraging popular libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-image. The segmentation process involves preprocessing steps, feature extraction, and clustering or classification to identify different regions within the image.
